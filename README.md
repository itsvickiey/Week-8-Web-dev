- **Modular JavaScript** ensures separation of logic for different features.
- **Relative Paths** are used to guarantee smooth deployment on any platform.
- **Accessibility (ARIA)** attributes are applied for screen reader compatibility.
- **Consistent Design System** — color palette, typography, and spacing are uniform across pages.
